Ellipse and its normals.

## Code
- [ellipseMain.py](ellipseMain.py) - Makes images which show number of normals for a grid of points, calculated numerically.
- [ellipseAnimaton.py](ellipseAnimation.py) - Makes animation of the point moving around the plane with the numerically calculated normals, along with plots of $l(t)$ and $\frac{dl}{dt}$.
- [ellipseLib.py](ellipseLib.py) - Contains functions used by [ellipseMain.py](ellipseMain.py) and [ellipseAnimation.py](ellipseAnimation.py).

## Media
- [fullAnimation.mp4](fullAnimation.mp4) - The animation generated by [ellipseAnimation.py](ellipseAnimation.py).
- [images](./images) - The images generated by [ellipseMain.py](ellipseMain.py).

## Misc
- [proof1.pdf](proof1.pdf) - The proof that the stationary points of the distance function between a curve and a point give normals of the curve.
- [numSols.zip](numSols.zip) - The full data for [images](images). Can be loaded into [ellipseMain.py](ellipseMain.py) to generate full resolution versions (must be first unzipped).
